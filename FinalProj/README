Hi! To explore my character creator, all you need to do is launch Processing
and hit "play"! Or, if you have Linux like I do, I have also created
applications for 32 and 64 bit versions of Linux using Processing's own
software. The 64 bit version worked for me, but I'd suggest just using
Processing for maximum "does what it's meant to do"-ness.
