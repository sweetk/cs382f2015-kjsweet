Honestly, I have no idea what I want my filter to do.

The first matrix I tried, {1, 0, 1} ,{0, 1, 0}, {1, 0, 1},
just came to my head because we were playing with Matrices
in a class this morning. But it just hurt my head.

I then remembered that they are all supposed to add up
to 0, so I tried {1, -1, 1}, {-1, 0, -1}, {1, -1, 1}.
I like symmetry. Turns out this does edge detection
but doesn't look as pretty as the one I took for
the bottom left from the convolution code in class.

I remembered I was actually really interested in the
blowout effect from earlier, so I thought "What if I
combined edge detection with blowout?" So I put a 4
in the middle. I don't think a lot of thought went into
selecting 4. But it looked, awesome, I thought.
Especially around her eyes. So I figured "What will happen 
if I put different numbers in the middle?"

So I played around with that for a little bit, and found
that I enjoyed to effect {1, -1, 1}, {-1, 1, -1}, {1, -1, 1}
had the most. Science!
