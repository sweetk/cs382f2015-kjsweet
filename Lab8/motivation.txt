For this assignment, I made up some numbers representing the various hair colors
of different majors at Allegheny College. Physics majors are primarily white,
with brown or sometimes naturally blonde hair. I have green hair and am a
Physics major. I figured the most opposite of this this chart would be one with
Art majors. Again, this data is actually entirely made up, but I figured these
colors were represented somewhere, with the biggest portion being black both
from natural and dyed sources.
